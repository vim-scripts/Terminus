Terminus enhances Vim's integration with the terminal in four ways,
particularly when using tmux (https://tmux.github.io/) and iTerm
(https://www.iterm2.com/), closing the gap between terminal and GUI Vim:

1. Cursor shape change in insert mode ~

In insert mode, the cursor shape changes to a thin vertical bar. On leaving
inset mode, it reverts to the standard "block" shape.

2. Improved mouse support ~

Activates 'mouse' support in all modes and additionally tries to activate
|sgr-mouse| support, which allows the mouse to work "even in columns beyond
223".

3. Focus reporting ~

Allows Vim to receive |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events, even in the
terminal and inside tmux. This is in turn used to fire the |:checktime|
command, which, in conjunction with the 'autoread', allows Vim to
automatically pick up changes made by other processes when switching to and
from Vim.

4. "Bracketed Paste" mode ~

Sets up "Bracketed Paste" mode, which means you can forget about manually
setting the 'paste' option and simply go ahead and paste in any mode.
